# Social-Dilemmas-of-Sociality-due-to-Beneficial-and-Costly-Contagion

This repository accompanies the preprint "Social dilemmas of sociality due to beneficial and costly contagion", by Daniel B. Cooney*, Dylan H. Morris*, Simon A. Levin, Daniel I. Rubenstein, and Pawel Romanczuk. It includes all of the scripts needed to produce the figures in the paper, the numerical computations of endemic equilibria presented in Figures 2 and 5, and the symbolic calculations presented in Appendix B.4. 

The repository is organized into two main folders: Scripts (containing all Python scripts) and Notebook (containg a Mathematica notebook and a pdf of the associated output). The Mathematica notebook AssortativeSocialityModel.nb is used to simplify some calculations in Appendix B.4 needed to calculate evolutionarily stable strategies in the presence of assortment. The Python scripts are used to generate all figures and for the numerical simulations of the two-strategy contagion model.

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.
